  utter_too_young:
  - text: Sorry, but you are too young to read this comic. 
  utter_ask_age:
  - text: What is your age?
  utter_ask_riddle:
  - text: So you want a riddle huh? Well here you go. Judi's parents have 4 kids. Their first is named Carter, their second is named Tiffany, and their third one is named Andrew. What is the name of their 4th kid? 
  utter_correct_answer:
  - text: Yes, you got it! You're clever, aren't you? 
  utter_judi: 
  - text: The answer is Judi. 
  
  utter_explain_riddle:
  - text: Okay, so we are told that "Judi's parents" have 4 kids, and then we are told that 3 of their names are Carter, Tiffany, and Andrew. Since "Judi's parents" have 4 kids, and we already know 3 of thier names, then the last one has to be Judi. Does that make sense now?
