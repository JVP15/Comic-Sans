  utter_did_that_help:
  - text: Did that help you?
  utter_happy:
  - text: That's great!
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  utter_condolance:
  - text: I'm sorry to hear that! I hope reading some comics will help cheer you up, so go ahead and ask away! 
  utter_howami:
  - text: Well, aside from the fact that I'm a just a program and have no feelings or emotions, I'm doing great! How about yourself?
  
  utter_explain:

           I'm Comic Sans, a chatbot powered by Rasa. I'm here to help you find the right comic for any situation, all you have to do is tell me what you are looking for. Try asking me to find a comic about machine learning!
           
           Normally, I'll just give you a link to the comic in the chat here, but I could also automatically open it for you in your browser of choice. I currently support Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, so just let me know what browser you'd like to use (or if you'd prefer that I just give you a link).
           
           I also happen to like riddles (okay, actually I just like one riddle). If you want to be challenged, then go ahead and ask me to ask you a riddle! 
  
  
  utter_ask_riddle:
  - text: So you want a riddle huh? Well here you go. Judi's parents have 4 kids. Their first is named Carter, their second is named Tiffany, and their third one is named Andrew. What is the name of their 4th kid? 
  utter_correct_answer:
  - text: Yes, you got it! You're clever, aren't you? 
  utter_judi: 
  - text: The answer is Judi. 
  utter_explain_riddle:
  - text: Okay, so we are told that "Judi's parents" have 4 kids, and then we are told that 3 of their names are Carter, Tiffany, and Andrew. Since "Judi's parents" have 4 kids, and we already know 3 of thier names, then the last one has to be Judi. Does that make sense now? 
  
  utter_too_young:
  - text: Sorry, but you are too young to read this comic. 
  utter_ask_age:
  - text: What is your age (kids, no lying)?
  
  utter_ask_why_dinosaur_comics:
  - text: What, you don't like Dinosaur Comics? Why not? 
  utter_accept_ryan_north_explanation: 
  - text: Well okay, I guess you must have some reason to dislike Ryan North. From now on, I won't send you any more Dinosaur Comics. 
  utter_accept_dinosaur_fear_explanation:
  - text: Well, I've lived in constant fear of being attacked by a Velociraptor, so I understand. I won't send you any more Dinosaur Comics. 
  utter_accept_dinosaur_comic_explanation: 
  - text: Fair enough. Dinosaur Comics aren't for everyone. I'll be sure not to send you any more.
  utter_ask_for_explanation:
  - text: You don't like dinosaurs? Well this opens up a whole new line of questions. Why not? Haven't you seen Jurassic Park? 
  utter_reject_dinosaur_explanation:
  - text: Well that just won't do. I'll keep sending you Dinosaur Comics until you either like them or you come up with a more compelling argument. 

  utter_dinosaur_comic_1:
  - text: Pretend that this is a dinosaur comic https://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=3817
  
  utter_default:
  - text: Sorry, but I can't find a comic based on that description. Try asking for something else!
