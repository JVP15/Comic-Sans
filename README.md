## Comic Queries

Comic Sans currently 10 comics for 10 different situations, so go ahead and ask for a comic about:

* machine learning
* work/life balance
* shooting for the moon
* the gnu manual
* text editors
* security
* statisticians
* server rooms/datacenters
* unicode
* nsfw (It's not actually nsfw, it just shows off the age verification feature)


## Viewing Comics

Typically, Comic Sans will provide a link to each comic in the shell window. However, Comic Sans can open a comic automatically in the browser of your choice (currently only supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). Simply tell Comic Sans which browser you would like to use by saying something like 'I want to use Google Chrome'


## Riddles 

Comic Sans also likes to tell riddles (well, one riddle really), so ask Comic Sans to ask you a riddle! If you don't get it, Comic Sans will explain it to you.

## Dinosaur Comics

Dinosaur Comics, by Ryan North, are beloved by Comic Sans, but they aren't for everyone. If you don't like Dinosaur Comics, let Comic Sans know but be sure to explain yourself. Comic Sans requires a good explanation, like hating Ryan North for kicking your dog (are you sure it was Ryan North? He seems like such a nice guy), and if you give a suitable explanation, it'll take your feelings into account when sending you comics.
